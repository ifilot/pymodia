## Purpose
PyMoDia is a python package designed for making SVG images of [molecular orbital diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_diagram) based on atomic orbital energies,
molecular orbital energies and orbital coefficients.
These energies and coefficients can either be obtained by using electronic structure calculation or be assumed to giving rise to qualatative diagrams.

This package makes use of the [drawsvg](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg) package to produce the SVG images.
SVG images are vector based meaning that they are great for digital purposes.

PyMoDia was made with educational purposes in mind but can also work as a visualiser in general.

## Documentation

PyMoDia comes with detailed documentation and examples, which can be found
at https://pymodia.imc-tue.nl.

## Installation
### PyPi
Use pip in a terminal
```
pip install pymodia
```
## Features

PyMoDia 
* Highly customisable
* Qualitative MO diagrams
* Quantatative MO diagrams
