# PyMODIA

## Purpose

PyMoDia is a python package designed for making SVG images of 
[molecular orbital diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_diagram) 
based on atomic orbital energies, molecular orbital energies and orbital coefficients.
These energies and coefficients can either be obtained by using electronic structure 
calculation or be assumed to giving rise to qualatative diagrams.

This package makes use of the [drawsvg](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg) package 
to produce the SVG images. SVG images are vector based meaning that they are 
great for digital purposes.

PyMoDia was made with educational purposes in mind but can also work as a visualiser in general.
