=======

:program:`PyMoDia` is a python package used for visualising 
:ref:`molecular orbital diagrams <background>`.
It can be used to make `svg images <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG>`_ using the `drawsvg <https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg>`_ package.

:program:`PyMoDia` can be used for educational purposes.
This package's main use is to produce visualizations which can be used for teaching.
Educators can perform electronic structure calculations and use :program:`PyMoDia` to produce clear visualizations or exercises for their students.
Besides using qualitative results, users can also produce more qualitative diagrams.

:program:`PyMoDia` can be easily coupled to quantum mechanical python packages to produce qualitative molecular orbital diagrams.
More on this can be seen in :ref:`examples <examples>`.
